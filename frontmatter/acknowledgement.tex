I would like to thank my advisor John F. Wilkerson, for propelling me into the most fulfilling and enlightening graduate career I could have asked for. Thanks to him, I saw a world big, and infinitesimally small. I would like to thank David C. Radford, for his charisma and curiosity. For pushing this dissertation far beyond what I could have imagined on my own. I would like to thank Iris Abt, who welcomed me with open arms and started it all. With her came a new family, without whom this would not have been possible. Iris, Chris, Felix, Felix, Lucas, Martin, Oliver and Xiang thanks to you, I know what I know.

Thank you to countless others in the LEGEND, {\MJMit} and UNC ENAP collaborators. Thank you for the countless times two shoulders to lean on. To the friends and family who believed in me, and to the new loved ones, which Munich provided more than once.
